Possible behaviors of "hero" - there should be a nice way to code this
* gravity (axis, strength, direction)
* initial velocity (direction, strength)
* bounciness
* friction
* moves every once in a while (jumps, scoots, etc)
* scale (larger/smaller)


Possible features to add
* "MOnsters" push the hero around or reset level on contact
* indestructible, impassible blocks
  * also ones that the hero can pass but creator/destroyer cant and vice versa
* Level select screen

Level ideas
*empty pit, no creator, destroyer has to "bounce" hero across

Bits to improve/fix
* make level prototype. Each level1 level2 etc. is implementaion of level template.
* gameEnd() repeats upon continuous contact with goal
* LAG LAG LAG WHY
* need to destroy onscreen objects upon level switch?
* make "herostart" and "goalstart" tiles to specify locations of hero and goal on map?
* make tiles paste in middle
