Possible behaviors of "hero"
* gravity (axis, strength, direction)
* initial velocity (direction, strength)
* bounciness
* friction
* moves every once in a while (jumps, scoots, etc)
* scale (larger/smaller)

Bits to improve/fix
* make level prototype. Each level1 level2 etc. is implementaion of level template.
* gameEnd() repeats upon continuous contact with goal
* LAG LAG LAG WHY
